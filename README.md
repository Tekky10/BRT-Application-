Smart Bus Tracking System Using Geographical Information System(GIS)

The system will aid its user in getting information on public bus system running in their vicinity. This makes it easier for a client/user to pick up a ride and the know route which these buses take and see the traffic possibilities with the aid of the GIS (Geographical Information System) and API (Application Programming Interface). The application is structured into modules where different activities occur depending on the needs of the client. The modules include action, concurrent, data-driven, logical and event driven modules. The application was designed using software development life cycle methodology. The software application was implemented using Java (Kotlin) for the front end and Apache CoucheDB for the backend and database system.
